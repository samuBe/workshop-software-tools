Installing VS Code
------------------

To install VS Code, go to `the install page <https://code.visualstudio.com>`_ and download the installer. This should allow you to set up the application.

The Different tabs
------------------

When opening visualstudio code, you can see an empty window. Here you can open a folder, or file or clone a git repository.

Go to github and make a new private repository and clone it in vsc.

Explorer
^^^^^^^^

The first tab is the explorer tab. The explorer tab shows you all the files in the project. You can create new files and folders here. 

Create a new folder, named src and put a file main.py in it. You can leave it empty for now.

Search
^^^^^^

The second tab is the search tab. Here you can search for certain words in the whole project. The shortcut for this is ctrl+shift+f.

Source control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The third tab, is named source control and contains everything to do with GIT. For now, we will leave this.

Extensions
^^^^^^^^^^

In vsc, there is a whole ecosystem of extensions, that make it easier to write code and expand the functionality of vsc. For now just install the Python extension. 

Terminal
^^^^^^^^

VSC has a built in terminal. It can be opened, by pressing ctr+j or in the menu above.
